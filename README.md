How does A* pathfinding calculate and prioritize paths?
A* works by finding the shortest different between two points on a graph by exploring said graph.

What challenges arise when dynamically updating obstacles in real-time?
Adding the functionality of changing obstacles during runtime presents a lot of challenges as opposed to outside of runtime. 

How could you adapt this code for larger grids or open-world settings?
Making the variables able to be changed dynamically to adjust to different factors.

What would your approach be if you were to add weighted cells (e.g., "difficult terrain" areas)?
By having the "weighted" cells be taken into account differently when it comes to the A* algorithm. Make them carry more weight than the "non-weighted" obstacles.
